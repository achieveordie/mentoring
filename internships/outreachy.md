# Welcome to Outreachy internships at sktime 2021!

sktime is participating in the 2021 Outreachy internship programme (https://www.outreachy.org). Join the sktime team for a summer full of coding, learning and fun. Be part of our diverse community and join our efforts to advance machine learning and time series analysis capabilities!

Outreachy is an internship programme explicitly providing opportunities to communities underrepresented in the technology sector.

If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to us on Gitter (https://gitter.im/sktime/community) or GitHub (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/discussions). 

## Why sktime?
Time series data is ubiquitous in many applications. Examples include sensor readings from industrial processes, spectroscopy wave length data from chemical samples, or bed-side monitor medical data from patients. Developing advanced time series analysis capabilities for researchers and practitioners is one of the major challenges of contemporary machine learning. 

sktime is a new Python toolbox for machine learning with time series and, to the best of our knowledge, the first unified toolbox for time series. Our ambition is to provide for time series what scikit-learn provides for tabular data. This involves extending scikit-learn to the different time series learning tasks, such as time series classification, clustering, forecasting and anomaly detection. To find out more, check out our [paper](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/assets/papers/sktime_ml_systems_neurips2019.pdf) published at the [Workshop on Systems for ML at NeurIPS 2019](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/). 

## How to apply to sktime at Outreachy 2021?
1. Submit an initial application to Outreachy by Feb 22, according to the Outreachy application process (https://www.outreachy.org/apply/). In case of success, this will allow you to apply for specific projects like sktime.
2. Choose sktime as one of your target projects, and solve an entrance task by making a pull request (PR) to sktime. 
This means opening a sensible PR, but your PR does not need to be merged yet. 
Find out more about how to contribute in our guide (https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/contributing.html). You will also need to record your contributions(s) via the Outreachy projects page (https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/).

The application deadline for completing all steps above is April 30, 4pm UTC. 

If you get stuck or have questions, please feel free to reach out to us on Gitter (https://gitter.im/sktime/community) or GitHub (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/discussions). 

## What we expect
We expect good performance over the whole project. This means that you are in daily contact with your mentors and wider community and that you work full time on the project. 

In addition to the individual project work, all interns will be required (and have the opportunity) to:

 * peer-review a fellow intern's or community member's work,
 * write weekly blog posts about your contribution and a final summary post at the end of the project,
 * have a good time web-socializing with the other students.

## What you can expect to get out of your participation

The internship will allow you to acquire cutting-edge skills and participate in intensive mentoring sessions, in highly sought-after areas of data science (time series, toolboxes, healthcare & industry applications). 

Ultimately, one of our key goals is to onboard new *long-term* developers who are willing to step up and become next generation leaders in open-source toolbox development.

## Candidate selection process
A pre-selection will be carried out for applications submitted by May 1 based on the submitted application and linked material. You will receive notification of the pre-selection outcome no later than May 2.

The outcome of the pre-selection can be either progression to the next stage or a rejection. In the latter case, we would still very much welcome collaboration and contribution outside Outreachy. For example, you may be eligible for (unpaid) mentoring as part of sktime's own mentorship programme (https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/mentoring.html).

If successful in the pre-selection, we will invite you to a structured interview (ca. 60 minutes length) with core community members of sktime, in the weeks of May 3.
Preferred dates are May 6 and 7. Please keep these dates free if possible.

During the interview, you will be expected to give a 10-minute presentation on a piece of Python code that you wrote. The interview will also focus on your motivation to join sktime, prior work experience, suitability for the specified project, and general technical background in data science and Python software development. 

The interview can have the following three outcomes:
* Acceptance to the sktime Outreachy programme 2021. This means unconditional acceptance to the Outreachy program with sktime. If you applied to, and were selected by multiple Outreachy projects, you have to pick one.
* Shortlisting and conditional acceptance to the sktime Outreachy programme 2021. This means the internship slots have been offered to different candidates, but you are a runner-up or on the waiting list. A slot will be offered to you in case a sufficient number of offers is rejected, e.g., applicants being accepted for sktime and another project and selecting the other project.
* A rejection for sktime Outreachy 2021. This means you are not put forward to any of the sktime Outreachy slots - but we would still very much welcome collaboration and contribution, outside of Outreachy 2021, if you are interested.

The selection outcome will be communicated to you on May 17, when the 2021 interns are publicly announced on the [Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/).

## What we are looking for

We're actively looking for contributors and your help is extremely welcome. Therefore, if
 * you are interested in time series, machine learning (ML), statistics, API design and software architecture,
 * you like coding in Python,
 * you are familiar with the basic data science ecosystem in Python, including numpy, pandas and scikit-learn, 
 * you enjoy working with a vibrant team of experienced ML scientists and software engineers,
 * you always wanted to join an open-source community,

then an internship with sktime is for you! You'll spend the summer working with our enthusiastic and open-minded team of developers who are creating one of the first comprehensive time series ML toolboxes out there.

We are also looking to increase diversity of the sktime community, thus we especially welcome Outreachy interns who are passionate about diversity and inclusion in data science, in particular those with the potential to become community champions of the cause in sktime.

## Projects
Projects are listed on the Outreachy project page (https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/sktime/), but we welcome your own ideas and interests on what to work on.
